                  >Primer, a U.K. startup founded by alums of Braintree and PayPal that provides a drag-and-drop
                  framework for merchants to build online payment stacks, last year raised $50 million at a $425 million
                  valuation from investors like ICONIQ, Accel, Balderton Capital and Seedcamp– a round the came amid a
                  bullish period for e-commerce, with record-levels of buying

                  >
                  and so have things at this e-commerce startup. TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that Primer has
                  cut a big swathe of its staff as part of a restructuring, as it looks to adjust to current market
                  conditions and extend its runway amid what many believe will be a tough year ahead

                  Sources tell us that some 85 staff have been let go — around one-third of the company, we understand.

                  >“We can confirm that we did have a reduction in staff,” a spokesperson said. “Like many other firms

               <p class="regular-text"
                  >The story of what is going on here bears spelling out because the same thing is likely hitting a
                  number of startups (and bigger companies) in the industry.</p

               <p class="regular-text"
                  >The long and short of it is that the wider e-commerce market has seen a major drop in activity this
                  year as the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic — or at least the acute response that involved masking,
                  social distancing and staying away from crowded physical spaces — has subsided. That activity was not
                  what many had predicted: many had presumed that after large numbers of people had shifted to buying
                  online, they would “never go back” to the old way of doing things.</p

               <p class="regular-text"
                  >That hasn’t played out: people are going back to shopping in stores, but more importantly, the global
                  economy has cooled down, inflation has gone up, and people are spending less. So companies that
                  expanded to meet demand are now retrenching.</p
               >
               <p class="regular-text"
                  >That has led to layoffs and restructuring even at some of the very biggest companies in the space
                  that you might have thought would be best equipped to handle economic ups and downs. Amazon, for
                  example, warned in its last quarterly earnings that sales would be lower than originally expected in
                  the critical holiday period. It has been cutting thousands of employees and rationalizing some of its
                  most costly product areas.</p
               >

               <p class="regular-text"
                  >Primer’s unique selling point is that it has built a very simple, no-code interface that reduces what
                  is usually a very complicated, fragmented process — building a payments stack and flow around online
                  purchasing, which includes not just the basic transaction but potentially different payment options,
                  adding in loyalty or discount codes, upselling to other products, managing customer information,
                  verifying against fraud and much more — into a set of drag and drop boxes for its customers both to
                  call in more features and visualize how they would work together. It offers integrations for dozens of
                  different services, underscoring just how fragmented the space is.</p
